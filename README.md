## Conquering a New Solar System: A Blueprint for Rapid Integration and Sustainable Energy Supply in the Game Dyson Sphere Project

This series of blueprints is designed to rapidly integrate a solar system and establish a reliable energy supply with a Dyson Sphere. Sufficient rockets and solar sails are being produced for 18 launch facilities and 64 solar sail factories.

The main system is divided into 9 blueprints to quickly fill up stockpiles and thus rapidly form a Dyson swarm. Moreover, the small footprint of individual modules means that there is no need to bury resources in the Earth, which is often the case with large blueprints. Each module takes care of resource procurement and produces all components in the perfect ratio for continuous operation. Each production chain is also coated with Proliferation Paint, making them particularly efficient.

There are also 4 additional blueprints that I would like to set up in new solar systems, but they are not directly related to production.

## How to conquer a new system:

* Planet Selection: It is usually best to choose the planet farthest from the sun, as the angles to the poles are flattest there. However, if there is a tidally locked planet in the system, it should be selected. Please note that the launch facilities at the poles may not be very effective in this case. Build your own infrastructure there for launching solar sails and capturing energy.
* Upon arrival on this planet, it's best to first construct a storage facility and temporary power supply. The blueprint "DSB1 Items" can be very useful for this purpose. The buildings required for this blueprint are the only ones that need to be brought along during colonization; the rest can be supplied from a mall later on. This storage must also ensure the supply of spray paint, initial supply of fuel, and space warpers.
* Sequentially build modules DS1 to DS6.
* Generate a pattern for a Dyson Swarm and also one for the Dyson Sphere.
* While the storage fills with materials and the swarm grows, mine the planet's resources with advanced mining machines. The DBS3 Mining Isle blueprint can be helpful in this regard.
* Finally, build modules DS7 to DS9 to produce the rockets and launch facilities for the Dyson Sphere.

However, the quickest way is to simply use the combined blueprint ds1-ds9.
